This is a fork and Chinese translation of project [giam](http://osj1961.github.io/giam/)
====
The original project is a fantastic book to learn mathematical proofing and the foundations of mathematics. 

For convenience, I used XeLaTeX for this CJK project and separated the Chinese version code into different files or directories.

I broke the paragraphs into shorter sentences to check the translation more easily. 

Of course, LLMs have done the most work, and it went well. I barely found any mistranslation, and I only fixed some LaTeX errors. I've got little time to check the content word by word, so please feel free to submit issues.

A Gentle Introduction to the Art of Mathematics -- open source text for an "intro to proofs" course.  Now hosted on GitHub at [http://osj1961.github.io/giam/](http://osj1961.github.io/giam/).
